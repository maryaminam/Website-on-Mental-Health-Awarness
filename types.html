    <p>There are nearly 300 mental disorders listed in the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). This is a handbook used by health professionals to help identify and diagnose mental illness.
        Some of the main groups of mental disorders are:<br>
        •	mood disorders (such as depression or bipolar disorder)<br>
        •	anxiety disorders<br>
        •	personality disorders<br>
        •	psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia)<br>
        •	eating disorders<br>
        •	trauma-related disorders (such as post-traumatic stress disorder)<br>
        •	substance abuse disorders<br>
        The diagnosis of mental illness can be controversial. There have been many debates in the medical community about what is and isn’t a mental illness. The definition can be influenced by our society and culture, but most mental illnesses occur across all countries and cultures. This suggests that they are not just constructed by social norms and expectations, but have a biological and psychological basis too.
