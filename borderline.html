            Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental illness that is marked by a chronic pattern of unstable relationships, poor self-image, and mood changes.<br>
It is also characterized by severe impulsivity. As with other personality disorders, BPD usually begins in early adulthood. Similar to the prevalence of schizophrenia in the population, BPD is thought to affect about 1% of the population and 15% of patients in psychiatric hospitals. In contrast to how often women seek treatment for schizophrenia, women tend to seek treatment for BPD at a rate much higher than men, so the estimates on how many men suffer from this disorder may be lower than the actual numbers.<br>
Individuals with BPD struggle with many difficulties. For example, women with the disorder are at risk for feeling less satisfied by, and more often coerced into, sexual relationships.<br>
One in 10 people with BPD commits suicide,and frequently engages in self-injurious behaviors like cutting themselves or overdosing on medication. People with this disorder who attempt suicide are more likely to have a history of sexual abuse compared to the general population.<br>

        <h2>What Exams and Tests Diagnose Borderline Personality Disorder?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="borderlinetreatmentpara">
        <p>
            There is no specific definitive test, like a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has a borderline personality disorder. Therefore, practitioners conduct a mental health interview that looks for the presence of the symptoms previously described.<br>
The professional also usually asks questions to explore (screen) whether or not other emotional problems like clinical depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, dependence, and/or other addictions are present.<br>
Mental health professionals will also likely explore whether the individual is a safety risk by having homicidal thoughts, suicidal thoughts, or other thoughts of self-harm.<br>
Ascertain medical conditions can influence how BPD manifests (presents), the mental health examiner will likely refer the individual for a complete physical examination and any tests they may need to better understand their medical situation.<br>
