        <p>Mental illnesses, in general, are thought to be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors:<br>
            •	Inherited traits. Mental illness is more common in people whose blood relatives also have a mental illness. Certain genes may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, and your life situation may trigger it.<br>
            •	Environmental exposures before birth. Exposure to environmental stressors, inflammatory conditions, toxins, alcohol or drugs while in the womb can sometimes be linked to mental illness.<br>
            •	Brain chemistry. Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body. When the neural networks involving these chemicals are impaired, the function of nerve receptors and nerve systems change, leading to depression and other emotional disorders.<br>

    <div class="riskfactorsp">
        <p>Certain factors may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, including:<br>
            •	A history of mental illness in a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling<br>
            •	Stressful life situations, such as financial problems, a loved one's death or a divorce<br>
            •	An ongoing (chronic) medical condition, such as diabetes<br>
            •	Brain damage as a result of a serious injury (traumatic brain injury), such as a violent blow to the head<br>
            •	Traumatic experiences, such as military combat or assault<br>
            •	Use of alcohol or recreational drugs<br>
            •	A childhood history of abuse or neglect<br>
            •	Few friends or few healthy relationships<br>
            •	A previous mental illness<br>
            Mental illness is common. About 1 in 5 adults has a mental illness in any given year. Mental illness can begin at any age, from childhood through later adult years, but most cases begin earlier in life.
            The effects of mental illness can be temporary or long lasting. You also can have more than one mental health disorder at the same time. For example, you may have depression and a substance use disorder.
